        <p> Welcome To my Website on Corona Virus</p>
        <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. <br>

            Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. <br> Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. <br>
            
            The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. <br> Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.  <br>
            
            The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so itâ€™s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow). <br>
